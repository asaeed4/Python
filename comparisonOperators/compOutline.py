This outline will help solidify concepts from the Comparison Operators lesson.
Fill in this outline as the instructor goes through the lesson.
'''

#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
z="blue"
x="red"
n=(z==x)
print(n)

#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
a=3
b=3
v=(a==b)
print(v)
#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
s=5
d=8
f=(s>d)
print(f)
#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
g=12
h=2
j=(g<h)
print(j)

#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
k=9
l=23
q=(k>=l)
print(q)
#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
c=52
v=31
m=(c<=v)
print(m)
#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.
>=5
